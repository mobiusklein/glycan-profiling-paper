\section{Discussion}

    We demonstrate that this regularization method improved the
    sensitivity and specificity of glycan composition assignment for
    LC-MS based experiments. The method used similar
    assumptions about the importance of common substructural elements
    of \nglycans to \cite{Goldberg2009}, but we extend this concept
    with the addition of a procedure for learning the relationship
    strengths and use broader groups of structures.

    The experimental results from the original analysis of \philbs and
    \phil82 demonstrated that while both strains expressed predominantly
    high-mannose glycosylation, \philbs expressed more larger complex-type
    structures (\cite{Khatri2016a}). In our findings shown in Figure~\ref{fig:philbs_assignments},
    we recapitulate these results while reducing the number of false positive
    assignments, after controlling for sulfated species as shown in
    Table~\ref{tab:philbs_reanalysis_comparison}\reviewfootnote{
        Should the description of this procedure be shunted to the supplement
        or should I describe the creation of a special database for Phil-BS
        permitting up to one sulfation not bound to a single residue and show
        the updated annotated chromatograms? The plotted performance does change,
        as do  the estimates of $\tau$ change just due to the addition of more
        glycans to contribute to each neighborhood, but the chosen $\lambda$ does
        not.

        I am leaning towards rewriting the earlier sections to specifically mention
        this.
    }. There are substantial
    differences in both the mass spectral processing and scoring schemes which
    contribute to these results, but the regularization procedure is responsible
    for recovering many low abundance features from this comparison. As these
    samples are derived from chicken eggs, we may have observed larger
    branching patterns than are observed in normal mammalian tissue (\cite{Stanley2009}).
    There is evidence for this in the \philbs with \textbf{HexNAc9 Hex10}-based compositions suggesting
    a seven branch pattern, though this cannot be determined without high quality
    \msn data. The $\mathbf{\tau}$ fit for both strains have smaller values
    in the neighborhoods of their largest glycan compositions as these
    features tended to be low in abundance and not high scoring in their
    own right, but were partially supported by the overlap with the next
    largest neighborhood, as expected.

    As we show in Figure~\ref{fig:rpserum_perf}, regularization improves the
    predictive performance of the algorithm.  We reproduce the majority
    of the glycan assignments from \cite{Yu2013}, but the ambiguity caused
    by ammonium adduction as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rpserum_assignment:c}
    makes a direct comparison of composition assignment lists difficult. Out
    of the eight missed compositions, four were missing because of insufficient
    data points to fit a peak shape, which requires at least five points. The
    other four were not detected either due to mass error, \cite{Yu2013}
    used 10 ppm while we used 5 ppm for FT-MS data, or due to low level signal
    processing decisions. Since we were unable to reproduce the published results
    from \cite{Yu2013} using their software and accompanying database, it was not
    reasonable to adapt our composition database to work with their software and
    run a side-by-side test to demonstrate how many additional glycan compositions
    one algorithm identifies compared to another without bias.

    Of the compositions assigned by our algorithm that were not
    mentioned in \cite{Yu2013} but were annotated in the original publication
    of this dataset in \cite{Hu2012} include \textbf{HexNAc3 Hex4},
    \textbf{HexNAc3 Hex4 NeuAc1}, and \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex3}. Because our database
    was constructed based on combinatorial rules that did not take into account
    all biosynthetic constraints, we include infeasible compositions in our search
    space, such as \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex10 Fuc1} and \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex3 Fuc1 NeuAc2}.
    Future work could be done to restrict the database to only biosynthetically
    feasible glycan compositions. This would also have benefits for the construction
    of the composition network where only those compositions which have an enzymatic
    reaction to from one to the other would have an edge connecting them, such that
    \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex6 NeuAc2} would not have an edge to \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex7 NeuAc2}
    as in our current model.
    
    These invalid glycan compositions can match LC-MS features at any point in
    the elution profile, though in this dataset the majority of these matches
    appear to be in the time range between 10 and 22 minutes, and similar glycan
    compositions that are biosynthetically valid elute later on in the experiment.
    This indicates a need for a retention-time aware approach to evaluating glycan
    composition assignments, as described in \cite{Hu2016}, but this is likely dependent
    upon the experimental workup and separation technique used. The definition of our
    composition graph and its neighborhoods also mitigates this to some extent, though
    it depends upon the feature scoring metrics to determine whether a feature is
    eligible for smoothing. These metrics were based upon a limited sampling of data
    and could be improved by acquiring more training sets to build more granular
    models in the case of the charge state and adduct scores.

\section{Conclusions}
    In this study, we demonstrated the advantages of our application of Laplacian
    Regularization to smooth LC-MS assignments of glycan compositions across multiple
    experimental protocols (\cite{Hu2012, Khatri2016a}). Our algorithm's performance is
    competitive with existing tools for analyzing the same type of data, while being more
    flexible.
