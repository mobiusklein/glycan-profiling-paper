\section{Differences in Assigned Glycans for \rpserum}

    Of the compositions assigned by our algorithm that were not
    mentioned in \cite{Yu2013} but were annotated in the original publication
    of this dataset in \cite{Hu2012} include \textbf{HexNAc3 Hex4},
    \textbf{HexNAc3 Hex4 NeuAc1}, and \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex3}. Because our database
    was constructed based on combinatorial rules that did not take into account
    all biosynthetic constraints, we include infeasible compositions in our search
    space, such as \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex10 Fuc1} and \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex3 Fuc1 NeuAc2}.
    Future work could be done to restrict the database to only biosynthetically
    feasible glycan compositions. This would also have benefits for the construction
    of the composition network where only those compositions which have an enzymatic
    reaction to from one to the other would have an edge connecting them, such that
    \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex6 NeuAc2} would not have an edge to \textbf{HexNAc5 Hex7 NeuAc2}
    as in our current model.
