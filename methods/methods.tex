\subsection{Performance Comparison}
    We compare the performance of the described algorithm with and without
    network smoothing. State of the art glycan LC-MS profiling software
    has been designed around Thermo-Fisher Scientific instrumentation, with
    support for their binary format (\cite{Kronewitter2014}, \cite{Yu2013})
    but not open community formats. MultiGlycan-ESI, though publicly available,
    was unable to be applied to the majority of our datasets because they were
    not acquired on that vendor's instruments, and their mzXML alternative
    did not produce matches consistent with their previously published results
    on \textit{Perm-BS-070111-04-Human-Serum}, and when ran on
    \textit{AGP-permethylated-2ul-inj-55-SLens} it ran out of memory. GlyQ-IQ
    was made available for testing by its authors, but required data be in
    Thermo-Fisher's binary format, it assumed that glycans were in native form, and
    did not make its test data publicly available.
