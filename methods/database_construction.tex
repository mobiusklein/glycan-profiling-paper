\subsection{Glycan Hypothesis Generation}
        In eukaryotes, \nglycans start with a common, conserved core of \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex3},
    building up to \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex9} (\cite{Stanley2009}). This structure is refined by
    sequentially removing monosaccharides and replacing them with more complex structures
    through a series of glycosidase and glycosyltransferase reactions, the enumeration of
    which as shown in \cite{Akune2016} yields over a million of possible \nglycan topologies
    and epitopes. These topologies define the geometry of the glycan, affecting the glycan's
    binding affinities and how the glycan may influence protein folding and accessibility,
    the glycan's functional aspects. The medium through which we observe \nglycan does not
    capture the full tree or graph structure of an \nglycan, so we reduce the topology to
    a count of each type of residue.

        Starting with the core motif, we generate all combinations of monosaccharides ranging
    between the limits in Table \ref{tab:glycan_composition_rules}. We created a copy of
    this database for native, reduced and permethylated, and deuteroreduced and permethylated.
    Let $n = 1240$ be the number of glycan compositions $\mathbf{g}$ in the database.
