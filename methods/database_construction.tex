\subsection{Glycan Hypothesis Generation}

    In eukaryotes, a 14 monosaccharide \nglycan of composition \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex12} is
    transferred to a newly synthesized protein in the endoplasmic reticulum by
    the oligosaccharyl transferase protein complex.  This glycan is trimmed to
    \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex9} during protein folding and quality control.  As the glycoprotein
    transits the Golgi apparatus, \nglycans are trimmed to \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex5} before
    being elaborated into hybrid and complex \nglycan classes (\cite{Stanley2009}).
    Glycan structures are refined by sequentially removing monosaccharides and replacing them
    with more complex structures through a series of glycosylase and glycosyltransferase
    reactions, the enumeration of, which as shown in \cite{Akune2016}, yields over a million
    of possible \nglycan topologies. These topologies define the geometry of the glycan,
    and it's protein binding properties. Neither $MS^1$ nor collisional tandem $MS$ of glycans
    can capture the full tree or graph structure of an \nglycan, so we reduced the topology
    to a count of each type of residue, a composition.

    Starting with the core motif \textbf{HexNAc2 Hex3}, we generated all combinations of
    monosaccharides ranging between the limits in Table~\ref{tab:glycan_composition_rules}
    to build a glycan composition database, which produced 1240 distinct compositions. To
    perform a side-by-side comparison we also extracted the glycan list from \cite{Yu2013}
    derived from the biosynthetic rules in \cite{Krambeck2005} with 319 compositions, and
    another database using all \nglycans from GlyTouCan (\cite{Tiemeyer2017}) containing only
    \textbf{[Hex, HexNAc, Fuc, Neu5Ac, sulfate]}, with 275 distinct compositions. As previous
    analysis of Influenza A virus samples detected sulfated \nglycans (\cite{Khatri2016a}),
    we also created a combinatorial database with up to one sulfate included, for a total
    of 2480 compositions. As our algorithm treats \textbf{HexNAc} and \textbf{HexNAc(S)}
    as distinct entities, for all monosaccharides with post-attachment substituents such
    as \textbf{sulfate} and \textbf{phosphate}, we detached the substituent from the core
    monosaccharide. Our implementation is able to interpret IUPAC trivial names and compositions
    thereof with standard substituent and unambiguous backbone modifications, permitting a
    wide range of possible glycan compositions.
