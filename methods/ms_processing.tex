\subsection{LC-MS Data Preprocessing}
    We analyzed samples from several sources, including both QTOF and Orbitrap
    instruments as shown in Table \ref{tab:sample_overview}. For details on sample preparation
    and data acquisition, please see the source citations. We converted all
    datasets to mzML format (\cite{Martens2011}) using Proteowizard
    (\cite{Kessner2008}) without any data transforming filters. We applied a background reduction
    method based upon (\cite{Kaur2006}), using a window length of 2 m/z. Next, we picked peaks using
    a simple Gaussian model and iteratively charge state deconvoluted and deisotoped using an
    averagine (\cite{Senko1995}) formula appropriate to the molecule under study. For native
    glycans, the formula was \textbf{H 1.690 C 1.0 O 0.738 N 0.071}, for permethylated glycans,
    the formula was \textbf{H 1.819 C 1.0 O 0.431 N 0.042}. We used an iterative approach which combines
    aspects of the dependence graph method (\cite{Liu2010}) and with subtraction. All samples
    were processed using a minimum isotopic fit score of 20 with an isotopic strictness penalty
    of 2.
