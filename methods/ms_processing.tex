\subsection{LC-MS Data Preprocessing}
    We used samples from several sources including both QTOF and FTMS instruments as shown
    in Table \ref{tab:sample_overview}. For details on sample preparation and data acquisition,
    please see their source citation. All data were converted into mzML format (\cite{Martens2011})
    prior to analysis with Proteowizard (\cite{Kessner2008}) without any data transforming filters.
    We applied a background reduction method based upon (\cite{Kaur2006}), using a window length
    of 2 m/z. Next, we picked peaks using a simple gaussian model. Scans were then subjected
    to iterative charge state deconvolution and deisotoping using an averagine (\cite{Senko1995})
    formula appropriate to the molecule under study. For native glycans, the formula was
    \textbf{H 1.690 C 1.0 O 0.738 N 0.071}, for permethylated glycans, the formula was
    \textbf{H 1.819 C 1.0 O 0.431 N 0.042}. We used an iterative approach which combines
    aspects of the dependence graph method (\cite{Liu2010}) and with subtraction. All samples
    were processed using a minimum isotopic fit score of 20 with an isotopic strictness penalty
    of 2.
