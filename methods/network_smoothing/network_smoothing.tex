\subsection{Glycan Composition Network Smoothing}
        Evidence for individual glycan compositions can often be enough to claim
    that composition had been detected. Lower abundance may score poorly in one
    or more features, leading to the glycan composition being discarded. Other
    methods have demonstrated it is advantageous to use relationships between
    glycans based on biosynthetic or structural rules to adjust the score of a
    single glycan assignment (\cite{Goldberg2009, Kronewitter2014}). We propose
    a method based on Laplacian Regularized Least Squares (\cite{Belkin2006}) to
    use evidence from glycan compositions related over a network to smooth it's
    classification of glycan composition feature matching.
