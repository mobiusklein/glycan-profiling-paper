\subsection{Glycan Composition Network Smoothing}
    Often, the experimental evidence an available for an individual glycan is
    sufficient to claim that the glycan. Glycan compositions with lower abundances
    may not present strong evidence, leading to those glycan compositions being
    discarded. Others have demonstrated that it is advantageous to use relationships
    between glycans based on biosynthetic or structural rules to adjust the score
    of a single glycan assignment (\cite{Goldberg2009, Kronewitter2014}). To improve
    performance, we propose a method based on Laplacian regularized least squares
    (\cite{Belkin2006}) to use evidence from glycan compositions related over a
    network to smooth it's evaluation of glycan composition feature matching.
