\subsection{Glycan Composition Network Smoothing}
        Evidence for individual glycan compostions can often be enough to claim
    that composition had been detected. Lower abundance may score poorly in one
    or more features, leading to the glycan composition being discarded. Other
    methods have demonstrated it is advantageous to use relationships between
    glycans based on biosynthetic or structural rules to adjust the score of a
    single glycan assignment (\cite{Goldberg2009, Kronewitter2014}). This idea
    has been explored more generically under the name "Manifold Regularization"
    (\cite{Belkin2006}) and specifically "Laplacian Regularization" when the
    Laplacian matrix of a graph is used to influence the parameter scaling. We
    apply this idea to weighted networks of related glycans with arbitrarily
    defined and overlapping sub-populations.
