\subsection{Glycan Composition Network Smoothing}

    Ideally, each glycan present in a sample under analysis would produce sufficient
    experimental evidence that they can be identified. In practice, glycan
    compositions with lower abundances may not present strong evidence, leading
    to those glycan compositions being discarded. Others have demonstrated that
    it is advantageous to use relationships between glycans based on biosynthetic
    or structural rules to adjust the score of a single glycan assignment
    (\cite{Goldberg2009, Kronewitter2014}). To improve performance, we propose
    a method based on Laplacian regularized least squares (\cite{Belkin2006})
    to use evidence from glycan compositions related over a network to smooth
    its evaluation of glycan composition feature matching.
