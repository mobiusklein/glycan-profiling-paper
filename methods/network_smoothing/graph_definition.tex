    \subsubsection{Glycan Composition Graph}
        For each database of theoretical glycan compositions we create, we
        define each composition to be a coordinate vector in a $\mathcal{Z}^{+4}$
        space, and represented by a node in an undirected glycan composition
        graph $\mathcal{G}$. Under this interpretation, we can compute the
        $L_1$-distance between two glycan compositions. For any two glycan
        compositions $g_u, g_v$, if $L_1(g_u, g_v) = 1$ we add an edge
        connecting $g_u$ and $g_v$ to $\mathcal{G}$ with weight $w = 1$.
