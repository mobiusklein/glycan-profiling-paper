    abstract = {Glycosylation modifies the physicochemical properties and protein binding functions of glycoconjugates. These modifications are biosynthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus by a series of enzymatic transformations that are under complex control. As a result, mature glycans on a given site are heterogeneous mixtures of glycoforms. This gives rise to a spectrum of adhesive properties that strongly influences interactions with binding partners and resultant biological effects. In order to understand the roles glycosylation plays in normal and disease processes, efficient structural analysis tools are necessary. In the field of glycomics, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is used to profile the glycans present in a given sample. This technology enables comparison of glycan compositions and abundances among different biological samples, i.e. normal versus disease, normal versus mutant, etc. Manual analysis of the glycan profiling LC/MS data is extremely time-consuming and efficient software tools are needed to eliminate this bottleneck. In this work, we have developed a tool to computationally model LC/MS data to enable efficient profiling of glycans. Using LC/MS data deconvoluted by Decon2LS/DeconTools, we built a list of unique neutral masses corresponding to candidate glycan compositions summarized over their various charge states, adducts and range of elution times. Our work aims to provide confident identification of true compounds in complex data sets that are not amenable to manual interpretation. This capability is an essential part of glycomics work flows. We demonstrate this tool, GlycReSoft, using an LC/MS dataset on tissue derived heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.

The large number of atoms incorporated in these molecules results in a low probability for the all-monoisotopic species. This produces the potential to misassign the number of heavy isotopes in a specific peak and make a mass error of ??1 Da, although the certainty of the measurement beyond the decimal place is greater than 0.1 Da. Statistical tests are used to compare the measured isotopic distribution with the distribution for a model molecule of the same average molecular mass, which allows the assignment of the monoisotopic mass, even in cases where the monoisotopic peak is absent from the spectrum. The statistical test produces error levels that are inversely proportional to the number of molecules in a distribution, which allows an estimation of the number of ions in the trapped ion cell. It has been determined, via this method that 128 charges are required to produce a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1, which correlates well with previous experimental methods. ?? 1995 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

@article{Liu2010,
    abstract = {Top-down proteomics studies intact proteins, enabling new opportunities for analyzing post-translational modifications. Because tandem mass spectra of intact proteins are very complex, spectral deconvolution (grouping peaks into isotopomer envelopes) is a key initial stage for their interpretation. In such spectra, isotopomer envelopes of different protein fragments span overlapping regions on the m/z axis and even share spectral peaks. This raises both pattern recognition and combinatorial challenges for spectral deconvolution. We present MS-Deconv, a combinatorial algorithm for spectral deconvolution. The algorithm first generates a large set of candidate isotopomer envelopes for a spectrum, then represents the spectrum as a graph, and finally selects its highest scoring subset of envelopes as a heaviest path in the graph. In contrast with other approaches, the algorithm scores sets of envelopes rather than individual envelopes. We demonstrate that MS-Deconv improves on Thrash and Xtract in the number of correctly recovered monoisotopic masses and speed. We applied MS-Deconv to a large set of top-down spectra from Yersinia rohdei (with a still unsequenced genome) and further matched them against the protein database of related and sequenced bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. MS-Deconv is available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software.html.},

@article{Goldberg2009,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In the past few years, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as the premier tool for identification and quantification of biological molecules such as peptides and glycans. There are two basic strategies: single-MS, which uses a single round of mass analysis, and MS/MS (or higher order MS(n)), which adds one or more additional rounds of mass analysis, interspersed with fragmentation steps. Single-MS offers higher throughput, broader mass coverage and more direct quantitation, but generally much weaker identification. Single-MS, however, does work fairly well for the case of N-glycan identification, which are more constrained than other biological polymers. We previously demonstrated single-MS identification of N-glycans to the level of 'cartoons' (monosaccharide composition and topology) by a system that incorporates an expert's detailed knowledge of the biological sample. In this article, we explore the possibility of ab initio single-MS N-glycan identification, with the goal of extending single-MS, or primarily-single-MS, identification to non-expert users, novel conditions and unstudied tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose and test three cartoon-assignment algorithms that make inferences informed by biological knowledge about glycan synthesis. To test the algorithms, we used 71 single-MS spectra from a variety of tissues and organisms, containing more than 2800 manually annotated peaks. The most successful of the algorithms computes the most richly connected subgraph within a 'cartoon graph'. This algorithm uniquely assigns the correct cartoon to more than half of the peaks in 41 out of the 71 spectra.},

Underprocessed glycoforms predominated at the glycosylation sites found to be involved in viral evolution in response to selection pressures and interactions with innate immune-lectins. To understand the structural basis for site-specific glycan microheterogeneity at these sites, we performed structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that the presence of immature, high-mannose type glycans at a particular site correlated with reduced accessibility to glycan remodeling enzymes.

To resolve the issues associated with having multiple formats, vendors, researchers, and software developers convened under the banner of the HUPO PSI to develop a single standard. The new data format incorporated many of the desirable technical attributes from the previous data formats, while adding a number of improvements, including features such as a controlled vocabulary with validation tools to ensure consistent usage of the format, improved support for selected reaction monitoring data, and immediately available implementations to facilitate rapid adoption by the community. The resulting standard data format, mzML, is a well tested open-source format for mass spectrometer output files that can be readily utilized by the community and easily adapted for incremental advances in mass spectrometry technology.},

abstract = {Summary: The ProteoWizard software project provides a modular and extensible set of open-source, cross-platform tools and libraries. The tools perform proteomics data analyses; the libraries enable rapid tool creation by providing a robust, pluggable development framework that simplifies and unifies data file access, and performs standard proteomics and LCMS dataset computations. The library contains readers and writers of the mzML data format, which has been written using modern C++ techniques and design principles and supports a variety of platforms with native compilers. The software has been specifically released under the Apache v2 license to ensure it can be used in both academic and commercial projects. In addition to the library, we also introduce a rapidly growing set of companion tools whose implementation helps to illustrate the simplicity of developing applications on top of the ProteoWizard library. Availability: Cross-platform software that compiles using native compilers (i.e. GCC on Linux, MSVC on Windows and XCode on OSX) is available for download free of charge, at http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net. This website also provides code examples, and documentation. It is our hope the ProteoWizard project will become a standard platform for proteomics development; consequently, code use, contribution and further development are strongly encouraged. Contact: darren@proteowizard.org; parag@ucla.edu Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Glycan structures attached to proteins are comprised of diverse monosaccharide sequences and linkages that are produced from precursor nucleotide-sugars by a series of glycosyltransferases. Databases of these structures are an essential resource for the interpretation of analytical data and the development of bioinformatics tools. However, with no template to predict what structures are possible the human glycan structure databases are incomplete and rely heavily on the curation of published, experimentally determined, glycan structure data. In this work, a library of 45 human glycosyltransferases was used to generate a theoretical database of N-glycan structures comprised of 15 or less monosaccharide residues. Enzyme specificities were sourced from major online databases including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Glycan, Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy), GlycoGene DataBase (GGDB) and BRENDA. Based on the known activities, more than 1.1 million theoretical structures and 4.7 million synthetic reactions were generated and stored in our database called UniCorn. Furthermore, we analyzed the differences between the predicted glycan structures in UniCorn and those contained in UniCarbKB (www.unicarbkb.org), a database which stores experimentally described glycan structures reported in the literature, and demonstrate that UniCorn can be used to aid in the assignment of ambiguous structures whilst also serving as a discovery database.},

We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively.

abstract = {Simple and complex carbohydrates (glycans) have long been known to play major metabolic,
structural and physical roles in biological systems. Targeted microbial binding to host glycans has
also been studied for decades. But such biological roles can only explain some of the remarkable
complexity and organismal diversity of glycans in nature. Reviewing the subject about two dec-
ades ago, one could find very few clear-cut instances of glycan-recognition-specific biological
roles of glycans that were of intrinsic value to the organism expressing them. In striking contrast
there is now a profusion of examples, such that this updated review cannot be comprehensive.
Instead, a historical overview is presented, broad principles outlined and a few examples cited,
representing diverse types of roles, mediated by various glycan classes, in different evolutionary
lineages. What remains unchanged is the fact that while all theories regarding biological roles of
glycans are supported by compelling evidence, exceptions to each can be found. In retrospect,
this is not surprising. Complex and diverse glycans appear to be ubiquitous to all cells in nature,
and essential to all life forms. Thus,
{\textgreater}
3 billion years of evolution consistently generated organisms
that use these molecules for many key biological roles, even while sometimes coopting them for
minor functions. In this respect, glycans are no different from other major macromolecular build-
ing blocks of life (nucleic acids, proteins and lipids), simply more rapidly evolving and complex. It
is time for the diverse functional roles of glycans to be fully incorporated into the mainstream of
biological sciences.},

abstract = {The glycomic profiling of purified glycoproteins and biological specimen is routinely achieved through different analytical methods, but mainly through MS and LC-MS. The enhanced ionization efficiency and improved tandem MS interpretation of permethylated glycans have prompted the popularity of this approach. This study focuses on comparing the glycomic profiling of permethylated N-glycans derived from model glycoproteins and human blood serum using MALDI-MS as well as RP-LC-MALDI-MS and RP-LC-ESI-MS. In the case of model glycoproteins, the glycomic profiles acquired using the three methods were very comparable. However, this was not completely true in the case of glycans derived from blood serum. RP-LC- ESI-MS analysis of reduced and permethylated N-glycans derived from 250 nl of blood serum allowed the confident detection of 73 glycans (the structures of which were confirmed by mass accuracy and tandem MS), while 53 and 43 structures were identified in the case of RP-LC- MALDI-MS and MALDI-MS analyses of the same sample, respectively. RP-LC-ESI-MS analysis facilitates automated and sensitive tandem MS acquisitions. The glycan structures that were detected only in the RP-LC-ESI-MS analysis were glycans existing at low abundances. This is suggesting the higher detection sensitivity of RP-LC-ESI-MS analysis, originating from both reduced competitive ionization and saturation of detectors, facilitated by the chromatographic separation. The latter also permitted the separation of several structural isomers; however, isomeric separations pertaining to linkages were not detected.},

abstract = {LC-MS/MS is one of the most powerful tools for N-glycan structure elucidation; however, it is still challenging to identify some glycan structures with low abundance. In this study, we investigated the chromatographic behavior of permethylated N-glycans. The relationship between retention times versus molecular weight of dextran, dextrin, and model glycans was investigated. Also, the nonpolar surface area of glycans was calculated and compared to their experimental retention times. Both retention time and nonpolar surface area trends are similar when the intermolecular interaction is included in the calculation. Moreover, retention time corresponds to glycan types and branch types. The N-glycans analysis model, which combines high mass accuracy and retention time, was applied to confirm serum N-glycans. In total, there were 78 N-glycan compositions identified. A linear relationship between retention times and molecular weights were observed for each subgroup of glycan structures, for example, R(2) value for complex N-glycans was determined to be {\textgreater} 0.98. Moreover, the retention time could be further applied to distinguish between structural isomers as well as linkage isomers. MS/MS data were used to confirm the structural isomers.},

abstract = {Despite recent technical advances in glycan analysis, the rapidly growing field of glycomics still lacks methods that are high throughput and robust, and yet allow detailed and reliable identification of different glycans. LC-MS-MS(2) methods have a large potential for glycan analysis as they enable separation and identification of different glycans, including structural isomers. The major drawback is the complexity of the data with different charge states and adduct combinations. In practice, manual data analysis, still largely used for MALDI-TOF data, is no more achievable for LC-MS-MS(2) data. To solve the problem, we developed a glycan analysis software GlycanID for the analysis of LC-MS-MS(2) data to identify and profile glycan compositions in combination with existing proteomic software. IgG was used as an example of an individual glycoprotein and extracted cell surface proteins of human fibroblasts as a more complex sample to demonstrate the power of the novel data analysis approach. N-glycans were isolated from the samples and analyzed as permethylated sugar alditols by LC-MS-MS(2), permitting semiquantitative glycan profiling. The data analysis consisted of five steps: 1) extraction of LC-MS features and MS(2) spectra, 2) mapping potential glycans based on feature distribution, 3) matching the feature masses with a glycan composition database and de novo generated compositions, 4) scoring MS(2) spectra with theoretical glycan fragments, and 5) composing the glycan profile for the identified glycan compositions. The resulting N-glycan profile of IgG revealed 28 glycan compositions and was in good correlation with the published IgG profile. More than 50 glycan compositions were reliably identified from the cell surface N-glycan profile of human fibroblasts. Use of the GlycanID software made relatively rapid analysis of complex glycan LC-MS-MS(2) data feasible. The results demonstrate that the complexity of glycan LC-MS-MS(2) data can be used as an asset to increase the reliability of the identifications.},

@article{Jaitly2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data generated from liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based studies of a biological sample can contain large amounts of biologically significant information in the form of proteins, peptides, and metabolites. Interpreting this data involves inferring the masses and abundances of biomolecules injected into the instrument. Because of the inherent complexity of mass spectral patterns produced by these biomolecules, the analysis is significantly enhanced by using visualization capabilities to inspect and confirm results. In this paper we describe Decon2LS, an open-source software package for automated processing and visualization of high-resolution MS data. Drawing extensively on algorithms developed over the last ten years for ICR2LS, Decon2LS packages the algorithms as a rich set of modular, reusable processing classes for performing diverse functions such as reading raw data, routine peak finding, theoretical isotope distribution modelling, and deisotoping. Because the source code is openly available, these functionalities can now be used to build derivative applications in relatively fast manner. In addition, Decon2LS provides an extensive set of visualization tools, such as high performance chart controls.

RESULTS: With a variety of options that include peak processing, deisotoping, isotope composition, etc, Decon2LS supports processing of multiple raw data formats. Deisotoping can be performed on an individual scan, an individual dataset, or on multiple datasets using batch processing. Other processing options include creating a two dimensional view of mass and liquid chromatography (LC) elution time features, generating spectrum files for tandem MS data, creating total intensity chromatograms, and visualizing theoretical peptide profiles. Application of Decon2LS to deisotope different datasets obtained across different instruments yielded a high number of features that can be used to identify and quantify peptides in the biological sample.

CONCLUSION: Decon2LS is an efficient software package for discovering and visualizing features in proteomics studies that require automated interpretation of mass spectra. Besides being easy to use, fast, and reliable, Decon2LS is also open-source, which allows developers in the proteomics and bioinformatics communities to reuse and refine the algorithms to meet individual needs.Decon2LS source code, installer, and tutorials may be downloaded free of charge at http://http:/ncrr.pnl.gov/software/.},

abstract = {Metabolic engineering of N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis to produce novel glycoforms or glycoform distributions of a recombinant glycoprotein can potentially lead to an improved therapeutic performance of the glycoprotein product. A mathematical model for the initial stages of this process, up to the first galactosylation of an oligosaccharide, was previously developed by Umana and Bailey (1997) (UB1997). Building on this work, an extended model is developed to include further galactosylation, fucosylation, extension of antennae by N-acetyllactosamine repeats, and sialylation. This allows many more structural features to be predicted. A number of simplifying assumptions are also relaxed to incorporate more variables for the control of glycoforms. The full model generates 7565 oligosaccharide structures in a network of 22,871 reactions. Methods for solving the model for the complete product distribution and adjusting the parameters to match experimental data are also developed. A basal set of kinetic parameters for the enzyme-catalyzed reactions acting on free oligosaccharide substrates is obtained from the previous model and existing literature. Enzyme activities are adjusted to match experimental glycoform distributions for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO). The model is then used to predict the effect of increasing expression of a target glycoprotein on the product glycoform distribution and evaluate appropriate metabolic engineering strategies to return the glycoform profile to its original distribution pattern. This model may find significant utility in the future to predict glycosylation patterns and direct glycoengineering projects to optimize glycoform distributions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The use of a molecular mass cutoff and a network pruning method typically limits the model size to about 10,000 glycan structures. This allows prediction of the complete glycan profile and its abundances for any set of assumed enzyme concentrations and reaction rate parameters. A synthetic mass spectrum from model-calculated glycan profiles is obtained and enzyme concentrations are adjusted to bring the theoretically calculated mass spectrum into agreement with experiment. The result of this process is a complete characterization of a measured glycan mass spectrum containing hundreds of masses in terms of the activities of 19 enzymes. In addition, a complete annotation of the mass spectrum in terms of glycan structure is produced, including the proportions of isomers within each peak. The method was applied to mass spectrometric data of normal human monocytes and monocytic leukemia (THP1) cells to derive glycosyltransferase activity changes underlying the differences in glycan structure between the normal and diseased cells. Model predictions could lead to a better understanding of the changes associated with disease states, identification of disease-associated biomarkers, and bioengineered glycan modifications.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: It is well known influenza viruses recognize and bind terminal sialic acid (SA) on glycans that are found on the cell surface. In this work, we used a data mining technique to analyze the glycan array data of influenza viruses to find novel glycan structures other than SA that may be involved in viral infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In addition to SA structures noted previously, we noted the sulfated structures in the mining results. For verification, we overexpressed the sulfotransferase that is involved in synthesizing these structures, and we performed a viral infection experiment to assess changes in infection in these cells. In our results, we found that there is a 70-fold increase in these cells compared with the control. Thus, we have found a novel pattern in glycan structures that may be involved in viral infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Glycan Miner Tool is available from the RINGS resource at http://www.rings.t.soka.ac.jp.},

@article{Spiro2000,
abstract = {The occurrence of sulfate substituents on several positions of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharides prompted us to determine the subcellular localization and temporal relationships of the addition of these anionic groups employing as a model system the hemagglutinin (HA) produced by influenza virus-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. It became apparent from a study of the HA glycoprotein in subcellular fractions resolved by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation following pulse-chase radiolabeling that sulfation of the complex N-linked oligosaccharides occurs only after they have been processed to an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-resistant state and have reached the medial/trans Golgi and the trans Golgi network (TGN), with the former carrying out most of the sulfation activity. Hydrazine/nitrous acid/NaBH(4) treatment of the HA from the subcellular fractions indicated that C-3 of the galactose as well as C-6 of the N-acetylglucosamine residues of the N-acetyllactosamine chains became sulfated in these post ER fractions, as did the C-6 of the outer N-acetylglucosamine of the di-N-acetylchitobiose core. Consistent with the specificities of the stepwise assembly of the N-acetyllactosamine branches, we observed that the 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS):GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase migrated in the gradient to a medial/trans Golgi position while in contrast the PAPS:Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase was found in both Golgi and TGN locations. In accordance with the concept that beta-galactosylation must precede the sulfation catalyzed by the latter enzyme, we observed the presence of UDP-Gal:GlcNAc galactosyltransferase in both these sites in the MDCK cells. The presence of the Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase in the TGN is particularly important in the influenza virus-infected cells, as it makes possible the addition of terminal anionic groups after removal of the sialic acid residues by the viral neuraminidase.},

@article{Campbell2014,
abstract = {The UniCarb KnowledgeBase (UniCarbKB; http://unicarbkb.org) offers public access to a growing, curated database of information on the glycan structures of glycoproteins. UniCarbKB is an international effort that aims to further our understanding of structures, pathways and networks involved in glycosylation and glyco-mediated processes by integrating structural, experimental and functional glycoscience information. This initiative builds upon the success of the glycan structure database GlycoSuiteDB, together with the informatic standards introduced by EUROCarbDB, to provide a high-quality and updated resource to support glycomics and glycoproteomics research. UniCarbKB provides comprehensive information concerning glycan structures, and published glycoprotein information including global and site-specific attachment information. For the first release over 890 references, 3740 glycan structure entries and 400 glycoproteins have been curated. Further, 598 protein glycosylation sites have been annotated with experimentally confirmed glycan structures from the literature. Among these are 35 glycoproteins, 502 structures and 60 publications previously not included in GlycoSuiteDB. This article provides an update on the transformation of GlycoSuiteDB (featured in previous NAR Database issues and hosted by ExPASy since 2009) to UniCarbKB and its integration with UniProtKB and GlycoMod. Here, we introduce a refactored database, supported by substantial new curated data collections and intuitive user-interfaces that improve database searching.},
